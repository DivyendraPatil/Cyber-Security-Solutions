Before Lecture:

The practice of keeping notes on git seems a great idea since I actually want to become a SysAdmin and the 
reason i picked up MS in Cybe Sec.

1] Read the introduction pdf throughly
2] Since there is no perfect way of putting what a sys admin actually does: manage or supervise the execution, use,
or conduct of a group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent computer- human elements

3] I actually check the website of OSLO university college in normway and they do give a Masters in the same!
Daymn. I was shocked the see a 120 credit course! but after close inspection came to know that every subject has 10 credits.
Relief.

There was this para i found interesting:
students would require access to a number of different OS when the schoolâ€™s system administrators strive for a certain level of 
homogeneity. In order to understand OS installation concepts, file system tuning, and other low-level principles, students 
need to perform these tasks themselves. Learning to debug network connectivity issues or being able to actually see the 
payload of captured network tra c requires access to raw sockets, which the staff responsible for the security of the campus 
network would certainly rather not provide.


So in short a System Administrator should know a lot of stuff, right from networking to security.
And all the knowledge and assumptions i had about being a SysAdmin has all gone to SHIT.
